			Welcome to my personal website.
			As of right now, this is a work-in-progress test version, so you won't find much interesting content.
			The picture on the right was taken by me during a skate session in the summer of 2021, on one of my 35mm analogue cameras.
			Right now it merely serves as a place holder, just like this text. Bli bla blub.
